# Introduction

SQL Queries don’t just access raw data, they can also perform calculations on the raw data to answer specific data questions.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called **aggregates**.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named `fake_apps` which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises:

- **COUNT()**: count the number of rows
- **SUM()**: the sum of the values in a column
- **MAX() / MIN()**: the largest/smallest value
- **AVG()**: the average of the values in a column
- **ROUND()**: round the values in the column

Let’s get started!

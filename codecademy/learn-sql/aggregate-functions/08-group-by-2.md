# Group By II

Sometimes, we want to `GROUP BY` a calculation done on a column.

For instance, we might want to know how many movies have IMDb ratings that round to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We could do this using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
       COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY ROUND(imdb_rating)
ORDER BY ROUND(imdb_rating);
```

However, this query may be time-consuming to write and more prone to error.

SQL lets us use column reference(s) in our `GROUP BY` that will make our lives easier.

- `1` is the first column selected
- `2` is the second column selected
- `3` is the third column selected

and so on.

The following query is equivalent to the one above:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
       COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

Here, the `1` refers to the first column in our `SELECT` statement, `ROUND(imdb_rating)`.

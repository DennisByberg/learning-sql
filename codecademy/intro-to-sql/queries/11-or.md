# Or

Similar to `AND`, the `OR` operator can also be used to combine multiple conditions in `WHERE`, but there is a fundamental difference:

- The `AND` operator displays a row if all the conditions are true.
- The `OR` operator displays a row if any condition is true.

Suppose we want to check out a new movie or something action-packed:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year > 2014
   OR genre = 'action';
```

- `year > 2014` is the 1st condition.
- `genre = 'action'` is the 2nd condition.
- `OR` combines the two conditions.

With `OR`, if any of the conditions are true, then the row is added to the result.

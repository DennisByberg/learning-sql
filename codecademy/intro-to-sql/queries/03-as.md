# As

Knowing how `SELECT` works, suppose we have the code below:

```sql
SELECT name AS 'Titles'
FROM movies;
```

Can you guess what `AS` does?

`AS` is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias. The new name can be anything you want as long as you put it inside of single quotes. Here we renamed the `name` column as `Titles`.

Some important things to note:

- Although it’s not always necessary, it is considered best practice to surround your aliases with single quotes.
  - Note that this practice is specific to SQLite, the RDBMS used in this exercise. When you work with other RDBMSs, notably PostgreSQL, no quotes or double quotes may be required in place of single quotes.
- When using `AS`, the columns are not being renamed in the table. The aliases only appear in the result.
